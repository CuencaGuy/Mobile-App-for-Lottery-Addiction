A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app for this information. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. For this project, we will be using historical data from the Canadian lottery available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascienceai/lottery-dataset)."

We will also use a function, `combinations`, which takes two inputs, `n` and `k`, and returns the number of possible combinations when selecting `k` objects from a possible `n` objects. Since the order in which lottery numbers are drawn has no bearing on winning the lottery, we need to calculate the number of combinations instead of the total number of permutations."
